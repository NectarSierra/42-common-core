# SO_LONG

![Grade](/circle_02/so_long/readme_srcs/grade.png?raw=true)

This project is a maze game in 2D
![Gameplay](/circle_02/so_long/readme_srcs/gameplay.png?raw=true)

we had to use a 42 library called the minilibx to make this game

to execute the game you will have to make, then execute the ./so_long "insert_maps"
since I've already made some maps you can pick one in srcs/maps.

I'm quite happy with that project I Did it with a lot of fun and even pushed the project a step ahead
by adding a way to show the pathfinding
![pathfinding](/circle_02/so_long/readme_srcs/pathfinding.png?raw=true)

Since pathfinding is a bonus if you want to actually see it you will have to make with the rule bonus (make bonus)

all assets are drawn by me and I think they look sick!
